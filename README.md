# NZ-Power-comparisons
A Spreadsheet to analyse / compare NZ power company offers for both Gas and Electricity.
First sheet calculates total cost for 1 month's (nominal 30 days) power consumption for various levels of usage.  This is done for a range of NZ national suppiers and their standard and low user plans.  These figures are then plotted on a graph.
Note 1:  Some suppliers may offer multiple different plans, typically mixing fixed and variable charges, which can be added as extra columns.
Input data uses ex-GST figures and adds government levies to relevant tariffs.
Tariffs will vary depending on your physical location so input data needs to be ammended as appropriate.  Figures provided in this template are for Lower Hutt, Wellington.
Calculation adds 30 day fixed charge to variable usage charge and adds GST.
Best option from a suppliers is indicated by the light blue cell shading and best / worst individual tariffs are highlighted in green / red.  There is often a crossover point between standard and low user tariffs.
Note 3:  There will be a range of possible discounts that can be applied to these figures.  These cover dual-fuel, e-billing, prompt payment / direct debt, EV car options which can vary depending on the plan chosen.  Their complexity precudes using them for this simple comparison sheet but will indicate which suppliers are worth modelling further on second sheet.
The second sheets takes a reference supplier's data, i.e. your current suppler(s), and compares it with the most promising alternatives for your typical monthly usage.  
Your estimated monthly consumption figures should be derived from the last few year's bills.  These do not necessarily follow the simple curve that price comparison sites are likely to use to gives a better estimate of potential savings, e.g. if you are likely to be absent for significant periods of time, especiaslly in Winter.  Of course different weather conditions throughout the year will impact the actual vs estimated consumption.
Additional monthly 'savings' figures are calculated for the best candidate plans to give a better understanding if savings are  made thoughout the year or only for lower or higher consumption months. 
For these calculations, the additional discounts applicable to that suppier are calculated with comparisons with and without dual fuel options.  Mixed suppliers may be the best option.
Again, the actual tariffs for your location and any discounts which you wish to use should be added to the appropriate cells of the spreadsheet.
All tariff data is subject to change.  Price increases can occur at any time and items such as line charges may increase despite 'fixed' price contracts.
